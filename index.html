                    <a> There is a need for more research to maximize GIS capabilities in tackling complex logistics, enhancing supply chain optimization,</a>
<a>route planning, and real-time decision making.</a>
<p>Inefficient routing in urban environments leads to higher costs and losses due to delays and inconsistencies in delivery services, requiring adaptable, future-proof solutions.
</p>
<h3 style="font-size:20px; text-align centre;">General and specific objectives:</h3>
The main aim of this project is to optimize logistics networks using GIS, enhancing efficiency by improving network planning, route optimization and decision-making processes.</p>
<p>The specific objectives include:</a>
<p>1.	To develop and implement a real-time routing algorithm that dynamically adjust routes based on daily customer orders.</a>
<p>2.	To conduct a comparative analysis of the current routing system and newly developed real-time routing system</a>
